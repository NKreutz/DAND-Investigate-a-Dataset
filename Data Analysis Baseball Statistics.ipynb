    "# Baseball Statistics Data Analysis\n",
    "#### Completed by Narissa Kreutz on August 2nd, 2017 as a submission for the Data Analyst NanoDegree by Udacity\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the Data Analyst NanoDegree, students are asked to complete a Data Analysis on either [Titantic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or [Baseball Statistics](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) data, limited in scope to answering 1-3 questions of their choosing. I chose to analyze the Baseball Statistics database. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [README](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2016.txt):\n",
    "This database was created by Sean Lahman, and contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2016.  It includes data from the two current leagues (American and National), the four other \"major\" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, andFederal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is comprised of the following main tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MASTER - Player names, DOB, and biographical info\n",
    "    - Batting - batting statistics\n",
    "    - Pitching - pitching statistics\n",
    "    - Fielding - fielding statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "It is supplemented by these tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - AllStarFull - All-Star appearances\n",
    "    - HallofFame - Hall of Fame voting data\n",
    "    - Managers - managerial statistics\n",
    "    - Teams - yearly stats and standings \n",
    "    - BattingPost - post-season batting statistics\n",
    "    - PitchingPost - post-season pitching statistics\n",
    "    - TeamFranchises - franchise information\n",
    "    - FieldingOF - outfield position data  \n",
    "    - FieldingPost- post-season fielding data\n",
    "    - FieldingOFsplit - LF/CF/RF splits\n",
    "    - ManagersHalf - split season data for managers\n",
    "    - TeamsHalf - split season data for teams\n",
    "    - Salaries - player salary data\n",
    "    - SeriesPost - post-season series information\n",
    "    - AwardsManagers - awards won by managers \n",
    "    - AwardsPlayers - awards won by players\n",
    "    - AwardsShareManagers - award voting for manager awards\n",
    "    - AwardsSharePlayers - award voting for player awards\n",
    "    - Appearances - details on the positions a player appeared at\n",
    "    - Schools - list of colleges that players attended\n",
    "    - CollegePlaying - list of players and the colleges they attended\n",
    "    - Parks - list of major league ballparks\n",
    "    - HomeGames - Number of homegames played by each team in each ballpark\n",
    "    \n",
    "As you can see, there is a wealth of information here, and therefore many questions could potentially be posed and answered with this data, many of which boil down to the question: How is a player feature (or combination of player features) related to measures of career success?\n",
    "There are many player features available to be examined, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Height/Weight/BMI\n",
    "    Right or Left-Handedness\n",
    "    Position Played\n",
    "    Games Played as a Starter\n",
    "    Home Runs Hit vs. Strike-Outs at Bat\n",
    "    Pitching/Batting/Outfield Statistics\n",
    "    Number of Seasons or Games Played\n",
    "    College Attended\n",
    "    Coach of the Team/ Sucess of the Coach\n",
    "    Team they Played for\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "And career sucess could potentially be measured in many different ways:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Salaries\n",
    "    Awards Won\n",
    "    Induction into Hall of Fame\n",
    "    Number of All-Star Games Played\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note that depending on how career sucess is measured, the other measures of career sucess could be used as player features (eg. the question: how does a player's salary (player feature) correspond to their probability of winning an award (measure of sucess)? could be posed)\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete an in-depth analysis of all possible features related to any chosen measure of sucess, Machine Learning Algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis would definitely be of great benefit. However, for the scope of this project, Machine Learning will not be used, and I will narrow my focus by defining sucess as \"Induction into the Hall of Fame\", analyzing only the player features contained in the Master table, effectively limiting player features to player demographics such as age, height, weight, BMI, Birth Country and Length of Career. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Therefore, in summary, the questions I will attempt to answer by conducting this Data Analysis is: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. How are player demographics, specifically height, weight, BMI, Birth Country and length of Career related to the probability of being inducted into the Hall of Fame?\n",
    "    2. At what age is a player most likely to be inducted into the hall of fame?"

Further statistical testing would be required to determine whether or not the differences seen visually in this report are in fact statistically significant, or if they would be considered within the expected normal deviation. \n",

The depth was also limited by the fact that I did not run statistical analysis on my findings, and was limited to 2-dimensional feature comparisons via visualizations, instead of running Machine Learning Algorithms that would have allowed n-dimensional comparisons."
